<p>A wonderful anime movie, it has a beautiful animation,a great soundtrack (my favorite song from the movie was Sparkle-Radwimps), and a plot twist that i wasn't expecting at all.<br/>
</p>

<h3>Scooby-Doo</h3>

<p>I have always been a huge fan of Scooby-Doo, his was the first scooby movie that i saw when i was a little kid, and you know, being a kid and watching a movie about a talking dog and 
his friends solving misteries was a very funny and memorable experience,
and it's a movie that you can watch with anyone and i'm sure it will make them laugh a lot.<br/>
