Hello everybody, my name is Jes√∫s Hilario, i'm from Mexico and i'm a junior web developer, i'm currently studying to get a degree in
mechatronic engineering, but i started learning web development some time ago as a hobie, because i wanted to learn new professional skills that
i could use for a side hustle.

I have a lot of hobbies, i really enjoy watching movies and playing videogames with my friends in my free time,
i like to play trading card games such as Yu-Gi-Oh, Magic The gathering and Pokemon TCG, and also i like to design parts for robots, 
because i'm part of a robotics team known as Scorpions Team.
